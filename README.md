**Inspired by Pineapple on Pizza**  
**Authors:** Enrique Juan Gamboa & Manuel Prada M√≠nguez  

## Overview  

**PineSounds on Pizza** is a Unity-based project focused on creating a rich, immersive soundscape for a playable island. Drawing inspiration from the indie game *Pineapple on Pizza*, we aim to replicate its tranquil exploratory setting while emphasizing detailed environmental audio.  

Our goal is to make the island come alive through sound‚Äîranging from gentle waves lapping the shore to the rustle of leaves swaying in the breeze. The experience is designed to transport players into a serene auditory adventure.

## Sound Design  

### Core Sound Effects:  
- [ ] **Footsteps**: Dynamic sounds depending on the surface (sand, grass, rocks).  
- [ ] **Ambient Background Noise**: Gentle atmospheric audio to set the mood.  
- [ ] **Ocean Waves**: Sounds of waves ebbing and flowing along the shoreline.  
- [ ] **Trees and Leaves**: Subtle noises of foliage moving with the wind.  
- [ ] **Small Creatures**: Sounds of insects and small animals to add life to the environment.  

### Stretch Goals:  
- [ ] **Dynamic Audio Zones**:  
   - Background sounds change depending on the island's section (e.g., forest, beach, mountain).  
- [ ] **Cave Ambience**:  
   - Echoing footsteps and other cavern-specific audio.  
- [ ] **Player-Environment Interactions**:  
   - Sounds for pushing objects (stones, coconuts) or traversing high grass.

## Inspiration  

This project is heavily inspired by the indie game *Pineapple on Pizza*, which became popular in early 2023 for its simple yet captivating exploration of an island. While *Pineapple on Pizza* focused on quirky visuals and interactions, **PineSounds on Pizza** emphasizes crafting an auditory experience that enhances immersion and tranquility.
